            <p id="firstP">When deciding what language to learn in an effort to either increase your job prospects, learn a new skill, or in my case, graduate Hunter  college, it can be really difficult to choose the right one for you. Do you prefer Spanish for it’s similarity to English, and due to the sheer number of Spanish speakers in the US and worldwide? Learning it will obviously greatly benefit anyone who lives in the United States. Or perhaps Mandarin for it’s challenging aspects, it being a tonal language as well as one containing thousands of characters to memorize and a completely different grammatical structure from English . The pros seemingly don’t stop there with how dominant a country China is becoming in its technological innovations and how politically powerful it is. Then there’s French, a beautiful language where even the most vile words sound like a lullaby to a non-speaker. Maybe you want to visit or live or work in France, the country that epitomizes romance and whose cuisine is lauded worldwide. What immediately comes to mind on that train of thought is German, the antithesis to French some might say. It sounds quite rough to non-speakers, but is still an interesting and wonderful language for it’s long strung together words and a culture that prides itself on directness, and quality manufacturing. Another language one might choose to learn is Arabic for religious or political reasons, if perhaps you want to join the U.N. or become an ambassador. So many languages to choose from, one gets caught in a paradox of choice.</p>
