            <p id="topPortionP" class = "firstParagraph">There came a time as a Hunter college student when I had to decide what language I was going to choose to take 4 semesters of. It's required. To graduate from Hunter, I had to choose a foreign language that I felt confident enough in passing for 4 semesters straight, or I wouldn't graduate, or graduate on time. It was a difficult decision, because not only had I taken an interest in French and German, leading me to want to choose from one of those, and not only had I taken Spanish and Italian in middle and high school respectively, suggesting it would be easier to just enroll in a class for one of those, but I was also really interested in the idea of challenging myself. I didn't want to take a romance language. I didn't want to take anything I had learned before in a classroom setting. I wanted a new experience. And honestly my options were endless in that regard: Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and many others, but then I saw Japanese. And what a wonderful sight it was to see among the offerings, because it was quite frankly perfect. I didn't want something too easy due to its similarity to English like Spanish was, but I also didn't want something usually too difficult for non-native speakers to learn like Mandarin. The completely different grammar structure, combined with it being a tonal language, seemed an obstacle too high for me to persevere for four semesters without giving up. Which is why Japanese was a perfect middleground.  And now, in my third semester of the class, I can say there are so many benefits to having chosen it among my other choices, and I'd love to share if you too are being faced with the question of "Should I learn Japanese?" </p>

                  <p>Now that you've seen some of the most prominent pros and cons to learning Japanese I hope you're better able to come to a decision about whether or not to take it at Hunter college. There are so many aspects that get considered when people are trying to deliberate over what language to acquire, and it can be such a tough choice, especially if your intentions are to become fluent and continue learning past 4 semesters. In learning Japanese you'll be able to move to Japan and choose to get a job if you so choose where one of the qualifications is being fluent in the language, however one has to remember that there aren't as many job prospects for non-native fluent Japanese speakers compared to jobs seeking applicants that speak Spanish, French, or Italian, among others. One has to also remember that there's a cultural difference that arises in the langauge and the mannerisms when speaking Japanese or in Japan. Some examples of this are indirectness being very common when speaking to others, such that the word "no" is rarely spoken and the word "you" is rarely used at someone when conversing with them. Additionally, there are honorifics used when speaking to or about others, such that you're rarely just saying their name, but also another label that describes their status in relation to you. Some examples of this are calling your nephew Tom, トムくん (Tomkun) but your friend Tom, トムさん (Tomsan). More things to consider include the overwhelming fact of how many Kanji characters one has to memorize to be able to read and write fluently in Japanese. Learning to speak and understand the language can thus be an entirely different obstacle to tackle from learning how to read and write in it. </p>
