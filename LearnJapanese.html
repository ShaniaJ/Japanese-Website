            <p class = "firstParagraph">There came a time as a Hunter college student when I had to decide what language I was going to choose to take 4 semesters of. It's required. To graduate from Hunter, I had to choose a foreign language that I felt confident enough in passing for 4 semesters straight, or I wouldn't graduate, or graduate on time. It was a difficult decision, because not only had I taken an interest in French and German, leading me to want to choose from one of those, and not only had I taken Spanish and Italian in middle and high school respectively, suggesting it would be easier to just enroll in a class for one of those, but I was also really interested in the idea of challenging myself. I didn't want to take a romance language. I didn't want to take anything I had learned before in a classroom setting. I wanted a new experience. And honestly my options were endless in that regard: Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, and many others, but then I saw Japanese. And what a wonderful sight it was to see among the offerings, because it was quite frankly perfect. I didn't want something too easy due to its similarity to English like Spanish was, but I also didn't want something usually too difficult for non-native speakers to learn like Mandarin. The completely different grammar structure, combined with it being a tonal language, seemed an obstacle too high for me to persevere for four semesters without giving up. Which is why Japanese was a perfect middleground.  And now, in my third semester of the class, I can say there are so many benefits to having chosen it among my other choices, and I'd love to share if you too are being faced with the question of "Should I learn Japanese?" </p>
